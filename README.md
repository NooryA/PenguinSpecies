# PenguinSpecies

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that utilizes various machine learning models to predict penguin species based on specific features.

## Overview

The project focuses on analyzing a dataset of penguins and applying different machine learning algorithms to accurately classify their species. The analysis is documented in the Jupyter Notebook: `Project1-215605306_Noor_AhamedSadique.ipynb`.

## Contents

- `Project1-215605306_Noor_AhamedSadique.ipynb`: The main notebook containing data analysis, model implementation, and results.
- `RandomNames700.csv`: A CSV file included in the repository. (Note: The specific purpose of this file is not detailed in the available information.)

## Getting Started

To explore the analysis and run the models:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NooryA/PenguinSpecies.git
cd PenguinSpecies
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: The `requirements.txt` file is assumed to list the necessary packages. If it's not present, you'll need to install packages as you encounter import errors.)*

### 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Project1-215605306_Noor_AhamedSadique.ipynb
```

### 4. Run the Notebook
Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Machine Learning Models Used

The notebook explores various machine learning models to predict penguin species. While the specific models are not detailed in the available information, common approaches for such classification tasks include:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- k-Nearest Neighbors

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset of penguins. Details about the dataset's source, features, and preprocessing steps are provided within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The outcomes of the different models, including their performance metrics and comparisons, are discussed in the notebook. Visualizations and tables are used to illustrate the findings.
